## Set the API Key for the Current Session

To ensure that your Census API key is saved to your R environment and persists across sessions, follow these steps:

```r         
library(tidycensus)

census_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY", install = FALSE)
```

## Save the API Key for Future Sessions

To ensure that your API key is saved and automatically loaded in future R sessions, run:

```r      
census_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY", install = TRUE)
```

## Verify the API Key is Saved

After setting the key using install `= TRUE`, restart your R session and check if the key is correctly loaded with:

```r         
Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY")
```

If it prints your API key, it is correctly saved.

## Manually Add the API Key to .Renviron (If Needed)

If the automatic method does not work, you can manually add your API key to the `.Renviron` file:

```r         
file.edit("~/.Renviron")
```

Add this line to the file:

```r         
CENSUS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Save and close the file.

Restart R and check if it's loaded with:

```r         
Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY")
```

## Load the API Key in Your Scripts

If you saved the key in `.Renviron`, you can load it in your R scripts like this:

``` r        
library(tidycensus)

readRenviron("~/.Renviron")  # Ensures the key is loaded
census_api_key(Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY"), install = FALSE)
```

Now your API key should be available for use in all sessions.
